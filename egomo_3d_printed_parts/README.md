# 3D-Print Your Xamla Egomo Sensor Head

You can use your favorite 3D printing service to produce the parts of an Egomo sensor head. For local 3D printing we can recommend [3D hubs](https://www.3dhubs.com/). For best quality prints (guaranteed to be accurately fitting) you can also order the parts directly [from us](mailto:egomo@xamla.com) or from our local 3D printing partner [UrbanMarker](http://urbanmaker.de/) (located in MÃ¼nster, Germany).
