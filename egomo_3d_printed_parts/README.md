# 3D-Print your Xamla Egomo Sensor Head

You can use your favorite 3D printing service to produce the parts of an Egomo sensorhead. For local 3D printing we can recommend [3D hubs](https://www.3dhubs.com/). For best quality prints you can also order the parts directly [from us](mailto:egomo@xamla.com) or from our local 3D printing partner company [UrbanMarker](http://urbanmaker.de/) (located in MÃ¼nster, Germany).
